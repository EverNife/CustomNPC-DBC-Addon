bugs:
can't descend from God/Mystic when its selected - FIXED
when KK selected and is 0, reverting causes rls to 0% instead of reverting CF - FIXED

disconnecting while in assigned form i.e SSJ Green turns to default "CustomForm" on reconnecting, because SelectedForm = "SSJ Green" gets reset


mixin cheatsheet:
when trying to inject with value="INVOKE" and shift up or down, you are cannot shift outside the scope you injected in

UI Heat(int jrmcEf8slc/double jrmcEf8slcD):

	-If heat bar full, player reverts from UI & gets Pain(jrmcGyJ7dp) SE

	-Heat bar -> the blue bar when UI, rendered in JRMCoreGuiBars.rendera()

	-default heat gain is 1 every JRMCoreComTickH player update tick

	-jrmcEf8slcD is double of jrmcEf8slc, used to calculate the gain for the heat Form Mastery(UI Heat Multi)

	-jrmcUIStateReach is the highest UI state2 player has ever entered, not the current state2


-Custom Status Effects: JRMCoreGuiBars.drawIcon for individual icons, JRMCoreGuiBars.showSE for all SE icon rewndering
	-Status effecticons are stored in assets/jinryuumodscore/icons4.png, each icon is 16x16 pixels, resourceID is icon number in icons4.png, starts from 0
