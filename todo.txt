90% - add kk/ui stackability
	-DONE - make forms stackable

		-add UI && KK state2 > 1+ multis, as all state2s of these forms will have same multi

add form mastery, timer, freeze player's DBCKiTech, DBCDamage event, Form selection GUI


bugs: 
can't descend from God/Mystic when its selected - FIXED
when KK selected and is 0, reverting causes rls to 0% instead of reverting CF - FIXED

disconnecting while in assigned form i.e SSJ Green turns to default "CustomForm" on reconnecting, because SelectedForm = "SSJ Green" gets reset


mixin cheatsheet:
when trying to inject with value="INVOKE" and shift up or down, you are cannot shift outside the scope you injected in
