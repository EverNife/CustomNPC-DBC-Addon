bugs:
can't descend from God/Mystic when its selected - FIXED
when KK selected and is 0, reverting causes rls to 0% instead of reverting CF - FIXED

disconnecting while in assigned form i.e SSJ Green turns to default "CustomForm" on reconnecting, because SelectedForm = "SSJ Green" gets reset


mixin cheatsheet:
when trying to inject with value="INVOKE" and shift up or down, you are cannot shift outside the scope you injected in
